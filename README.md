# Jade Chen — Online Resume

This repository contains a simple, responsive static website that serves as an online resume for Jade Chen. It is built with plain HTML, CSS and a small JavaScript file for light interaction.

## What you get
- A polished single-page resume with sections for contact, skills, experience and education.
- Small animation: scroll reveal for sections and animated skill bars.
- Easy to customize background image (`back_image.jpg`) and content.

## Repository structure

- `index.html` — The main resume page (entry point).
- `style.css` — Styling and layout for the site.
- `script.js` — Small JS for scroll reveal and skill-bar animations.
- `back_image.jpg` — (optional) background image used by the page.
- Other files: backups like `script.js.bak` and `style.css.bak` may be present.

## Run locally

1. Quick open: double-click `index.html` to open in your default browser.
2. Recommended (local HTTP server):

```powershell
cd 'c:\Users\jadeyu\Desktop\Jade_resume'
py -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

3. Using VS Code: install the Live Server extension and choose "Open with Live Server" on `index.html`.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (for example `Jade_resume`).
2. Push the project to the repository (use `main` branch).
3. In the repository on GitHub, go to Settings → Pages, set the source to `main` / `root` and save.
4. Wait a few minutes — your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/Jade_resume/`.

## Notes

- If you push via HTTPS, you may need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of a password.
- Keep any sensitive or private files out of the repository.
